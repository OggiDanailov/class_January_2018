 Day 1  
**Welcome to class** 

##What is the goal of this course:
1. ####First goal is to get you a job - 
	this goes through learning the material. 
2. ####Second goal is to get you to the point that you are indepenedent
 - meaning, once you graduate you can proceed to study on your own without the help of anyone else. Being indepenedent requires a habit - to investigate everything on your own before coming for help. The more you can resolve on your own the better position you will be when we finish the course.

 - ##Material: 

 

	a) Month 1 - Front End
	1. HTML/CSS
	2. Git/GitHub
	3. Javascript
Probably the most important part in terms of knowledge; JS is the most important language and skill that you can get from this course. Everybody uses JS; it is highly unlikley to end up in a profesional web development environment where JS is not used on some level.	


	b) Month 2 - Back End
	1. Ruby
	2. Sinatra
	3. Databases
	4. Rails
There are many questions and hesitations why do we do Rails; it is true that Rails is not the most common back end application right now; however, Rails is probably the best back end framework to start with. It is easier, faster and still covers all general concepts of the backedn framework - databases, MVC model, CRUD etc. Nodejs may be more appealing but it is much harder and confusing. This is exactly what I mentioned in my previously - by getting to know Rails well you should be in a great position after graduating this course to start exploring whatever alternative backend Framework that you want. Rails is the introduction, the bridge to alternative frmaeworks.

	c) Month 3 - Full Stack 
	1. Rails blog
	2. Shipped
	3. Final Group Project
	4. Final project (2 weeks)
This is the time that you will mostly learn. This is the time when everyone of you will go deeper into his or her app; this is the time when everything will start clicking and you will see the whole cycle of creating an app in action. This is the time when teachers' help will be much harder and longer; that's why it is important throughout the course to get to the position of being able to research all your problems on your own.

- ##How the classes will go:
There is not specific structure of any given day of the week. We may have a day that it is full entirely with lectures, there may be a day that it is workshop all day long.
Overall, lectures and new material will be covered in the morning - important to be on time as I do start at 10am.
- ####Coding challenges
-  Mornings in the first two months will start with some sort of coding challenges - coding challenges are the way of learning how the code functions, how to use logic. It is super important because you will face soon or late at an interview - in person or at home -a coding challenge. The more you do them the better understanding you will have of the specific language. They will teach you how to break a problem. You will see how sometimes a problem looks super complex and when you break it it turns out that it is not that complex; unfortunately you will experience the other problem too.
During lectures you are encouraged to ask questions; if there is something that it is not clear I will repeat it; if necessary I will come up with alternative explanation if the given explanation doesn't make sense to the students.
 - ####classmate's help
 very important aspect; you may get something that your neighbor won't; she may understand something that you won't. You will be working in groups constantly - another very important part of the webdevelopment - so you should get in the habit of constantly speaking with your classmates. One of the things that I would like to boost up during this cohort (based on learning experience from the previous one) is more interaction between the students; I will urge sometimes to go over problems together.
 Always speak up!!
 
 - ##Teaching Style
We will be following the slides loosly; It means that I will cover more or less the material that it is in the slides chronologically. However, I will not read them or use them much during class; you can read, you are encouraged to read them at home . There will be a lot of concepts that are not in the slides and also there are some concepts in the slides that I will not cover them since I don't find them very important or interesting. I will be building apps from scratch; I will share the files with you so it is up to you whether or not you follow me. Not the fastest typer in the world so you shouldn't have problems to follow me. 
I will try not to leave anyone behind. I am not here to cover certain material; I am here to teach you so it is more important to understand well 80% of the material than cover 100% of the material and not understand it. Which brings me to the LEARNING part:

- ##Learning
- The most important aspect of this for me is to UNDERSTAND the material; You have to know what it is going on; why certain things happen. If the majority of the class does not understand something speicific I will repeat it; if necessary we will repeat the whole lecture from scratch; if 3 people do not understand something then Jeremy will bring them to another room and explain everything from scratch to them when for example the class has worshop time. 
You need to understand. The goal is not to build but to understand what you are building and how you are building it. 
- ####learning practice
- unfortunately I don't have a right answer to this question. It is individual thing. Examples of studying music, real language and studying history. Programming is much more like music and real language- the pace is slow the slope is arduous, the progress is slow too. You can't start speaking German in one month; you can't become great developer in a month either. SO you need a lot of patience.
- ####bad learning practice
- video addicts - wathcing videos can be very useful but also can be kind of waste of time. You will find tons of videos on every problem or language we are dealing with. SOme of them will be terrible - some of them will be better. However, the key factor here is that in order to use usefully a video you need to understand what it is going on in it. Frequently the video authors won't explain why do they do certian things; they will just build something. It is easy to follow a video and build something; but that doesn't mean that you understand what it is going on. I have seen many students how can't build anything without watching a video - they need a constant guidance. they can't build Twitter app on thier own. This is NOT the goal of this course.
- plagiarism - you can copy/paste directly code from somewhere  - clear case of plagiarism. However, following 100% video tutorial is also a sort of plagiarism. You are welcome to follow videos but don't give me the final product as a home work.

Terminal Commands  
- pwd  
- ls  
- cd  
- touch  
- mkdir  
- rm  
- cp  
- mv - this one both renames and moves files   
- up arrow and tab - faster typing in terminal  

Workshop in class:

Navigate to your Desktop folder. Create a new directory called project-one. Change into this directory and create a new file called index.html. Verify what directory you are currently in. Delete the file. Create it again. List the files in the directory. Create a hidden file (starting with a dot). List all files in the directory including the hidden file.  ls

Create a new folder inside of your Desktop folder. Rename the folder. Change directory to be inside of the folder. Create two new files. Delete one of these files, rename the other one. Create a new file that starts with a dot (a hidden file). Verify what directory you are currently in. Show all files in this directory including the hidden file. Rename the hidden file.  

Prepare a new website:
Make a folder on your Documents and call it WWW
Navigate into WWW make a new folder and call it: NYCDANEWS <- this will be your website folder
Inside this folder make an index.html file using $ touch
Also, inside this folder make two folders namely: css and images
Navigate into the css folder and make a mystyle.css using touch command
