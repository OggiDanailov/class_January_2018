// Tail Call Optimization
// One problem with contemporary implementations of JavaScript is that they donâ€™t
//  have a standard way to prevent recursive functions from stacking up on themselves
//   indefinitely, and eating away at memory until they exceed the capacity of the engine.
//    JavaScript recursive functions need to keep track of where they were called from each time,
//     so they can resume at the correct point.

// In many functional languages, such as Haskell and Scheme, this is managed using a technique called tail 
// call optimization. With tail call optimization, each successive cycle in a recursive function would 
// take place immediately, instead of stacking up in memory.
// Theoretically, tail call optimization is part of the standard for ECMAScript 6,
//  currently the next version of JavaScript, however it has yet to be fully implemented by most platforms.
