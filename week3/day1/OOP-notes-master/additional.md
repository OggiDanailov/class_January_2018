Common programming paradigms include:

imperative which allows side effects,
functional which disallows side effects,
declarative which does not state the order in which operations execute,
object-oriented which groups code together with the state the code modifies,
procedural which groups code into functions,
logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and
symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar

Built-in JS constructors:

var x1 = new Object();    // A new Object object
var x2 = new String();    // A new String object
var x3 = new Number();    // A new Number object
var x4 = new Boolean();   // A new Boolean object
var x5 = new Array();     // A new Array object
var x6 = new RegExp();    // A new RegExp object
var x7 = new Function();  // A new Function object
var x8 = new Date();      // A new Date object
