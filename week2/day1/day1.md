Javascript

- OOP = Object Oriented Programming - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

1. High level programming language - high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts

2. prototype-based -  behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes


 - Examples of programming thinking - breaking problems to blocks and building something gradually;

 - Example of calculator:
 
 1. We need two inputs where we can insert two numbers;
 2.  We need a way of targeting these two values in JS;  
 3. Once we can grab the values we will need buttons that will perform the math; lets say + sign;
 4. When we prcess the + button we have to create a method that adds the values from input 1 and input 2
 5. We print the result of the previous operation on the screen

 

Javascript is the DOM (Document Object Model) langauge; it allows you to interact with your browser in a way CSS does. 
All browsers support it; 
It was first created and deployed in 1995;  
Jquery - 2006   
Node.js - 2009  
Angularjs - 2010  
Reactjs - 2013  
Vuejs - 2014  

 - Connect JS file with HTML;  
 - console.log() - it is used only to print something on the console;  
 - alert() - you will print the same thing but on the screen;  

(example1 for students) - what is DOM manipulation and what we will be doing in the next couple of weeks;


###Exercise 1
Your first JavaScript•
-    Create a JavaScript that sends an alert to the user that says "Hello World"  
- do the same with console.log  

 - what is a variable (var)? container where you can store any data;
 types of data:
 - string;  
 - number;  
 - boolean;  
 - Undefined;  
 - null;  

- examples on the console of all of them;  


- Operators
-  = =, -, *, /
- > , >=, =, ==, ===, !==, !=;
- % - modulo;

&& and ||
true vs false

- Arrays;  
- example of multi-dimensional array;
- indexOf

- Objects - object literal
- examples  

###Exercise 2
•   Create a script with two variables assigned to two numbers. Add them together and output the result to the console  
•   Try to add two strings together and output the result to an alert (concatinate);   
•   Create an object that holds information about you. Include firstName, lastName, birthday and an array of interests. Print each property out to the console.

If/Else statements

###Exercise 3

Write a program that checks if a variable is less than 10. If it is, alert the user that their variable is less than 10. If it is not, let the user know what the variable was and that it was greater than 10.  
•   Try running the script and then changing the variable's value to see how this affects the program output  
•   If you have extra time, write a similar program to check if a string stored in a variable is the same as another string


- Functions

###Exercise 4   
• Declare a function that takes a name as an argument and tells the user what name they've entered, try invoking it after it has been declared  
•   Declare a function that takes no arguments but prints something to the console, try invoking it after it has been declared  
•   Declare a function that, depending upon which virtual "door" was entered, tells the user they've received a different "prize" in an alert. Try running it after it has been declared a few times with each door option

- Loops
- for loop

###Exercise 5
•   Create an array filled with several strings of names  
•   Use a loop to print out the names, followed by 'is my friend'. Like so:>>Jake is my friend John is my friend Samantha is my friend Billy is my friend

 - while loop
 x = 6;  
 while(x < 10){  
 console.log("On number " + x)  
 x++;}  
 
 ###Exercise 6
 
 Create a while loop that "sings" the classic song "99 Bottles of Root Beer on the Wall"  
 . The code it outputs to the console should look similar to this:  
 •   "99 bottles of root beer on the wall, 99 bottles of root beer...take one down, pass it around 98 bottles of root beer on the wall, 98 bottles of root beer on the wall, 98 bottles of root beer...take one down, pass it around 97 bottles of root beer on the wall," etc., all the way to 0 bottles.
