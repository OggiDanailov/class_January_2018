- JS - Single threaded - executed one at the time. JS behaves in a single threaded manner.
- Synchronous - on at a time in the order.

Syntax parser - a prorgram that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid;

Lexical Environment - where something sits physically in the code you wrote;

Execution context - a wrapper  to help manage the code that it is running 


A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

Different PRogramming paradigms:

Procedual Programming;
	-	Procedural Programming based upon the concept of the procedure call, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a programâ€™s execution, including by other procedures or itself. Major procedural programming languages are COBOL, BASIC, C, ADA and GO
OOP;
	-  Object Oriented Programming based on the concept of objects, which contains data(attributes) and procedures(methods). This pattern is more closer to Functional Programming. Significant object-oriented languages include C++, Java, PHP, C#, Python, Ruby, Swift etc.
Meta Programming:
	-  Meta Programming have the ability to treat programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
Imperative Programming;
	-  Imperative Pattern focuses on describing how a program operates, it consists of commands for the computer to perform.

Functional Programming;
	-  Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

	Functional programming is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

Declarative Programming;
	-  Declarative Pattern focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.
